This is a tennis scoring system developed for Evnex Tennis tournament with only one set.
Two main methods were developed to keep track of the score, they are "score" and "pointWonBy".

The "score" method returns a string of the current set score, followed by the current game score.
The "pointWonBy" method indicates who won the point and adjusts the score accordingly.

Additional methods created were "checkGame", "checkSet", and "checkTieBreak" which support the "pointWonBy" method.
These methods check if a game, set or tie break have been won and output a message to the user, respectively.
