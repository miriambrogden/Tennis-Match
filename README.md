This is a tennis scoring system developed for Evnex Tennis tournament with only one set.
Two methods were developed to keep track of the score, they are "score" and "pointWonBy".

The "score" method returns a string of the current set score, followed by the current game score.
The "pointWonBy" method indicates who won the point and adjusts the score accordingly.
